I'll help you create a similar URL opener using Flask, Tailwind CSS, and some JavaScript. Let's break this down into steps:
URL Opener Web ApplicationClick to open code
Let me walk you through how to set up and deploy this application:

Setup your environment:

bashCopymkdir url-opener
cd url-opener
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install flask gunicorn

Create the project structure:

bashCopyurl-opener/
├── app.py
└── templates/
    └── index.html

Copy the code from the artifact above into the respective files.
Test locally:

bashCopypython app.py
Visit http://localhost:5000 to see your application.

Deploy to a platform like Heroku:

First, create these additional files:
bashCopy# requirements.txt
flask==2.0.1
gunicorn==20.1.0

# Procfile
web: gunicorn app:app
Then deploy:
bashCopy# Install Heroku CLI if you haven't
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
heroku create your-app-name
git push heroku main
Key features of this implementation:

Clean, responsive UI using Tailwind CSS
Real-time URL counter
Auto-adds https:// if protocol is missing
Clear instructions for users
Error handling for invalid URLs
Mobile-friendly design

Alternative deployment options:

Python Anywhere (free tier available)
DigitalOcean App Platform
Google Cloud Run
AWS Elastic Beanstalk

-------------------------------------------

Lets skip the deployment and continue to build locally for now.

I would like you to include 3  of your suggested features:
* Open URLs in random order
* Basic analytics (how many URLs opened, most common domains)
* History of recently opened URL sets
